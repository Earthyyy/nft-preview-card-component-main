## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (Probably)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - For Box Shadows


### What I learned

I used for the first time BEM approach for naming classes. Organizing the stylesheet file and using Semantic HTML markups make the project more appealing for the reader. Furthermore, it makes developing websites faster and easier

### Difficulties
* Box shadows are hard to determine without the figma file, so I chose some random box shadows that fit the design

* I tried adding svg icons with ::before pseudo element, but it didn't work. I figured out later that I can use inline-flex in the main component to align both elements properly
